# ml-pipeline

This is a short tutorial on the wonders of `sklearn.compose` and configuration-based preprocessing in machine learning.

## Getting started

There are two main notebooks, `ml-pipeline.ipynb` and `ml-pipeline-slides.ipynb`. The former is a much verbose dive into the content, whereas the latter is intended to be viewed as Jupyter Notebook slides.

To view/run both notebooks from within the Jupyter Notebook server, simply type:

```shell
$ sh setup.sh && sh start-server.sh
```

From there, you'll be able to open whichever notebook you like and view the content.

If you'd prefer to view the slides, simply type:

```shell
$ sh setup.sh && sh to-slides.sh
```
